# studentLibrary
This program is a simulation of a library and will allow the users to create student, librarian, and administrator accounts. This can be done through signing up (or logging in if already have signed up). Then allows students to check out or return books, librarians to create new books/remove current books from the database, and administrators to delete current students or add new students to the database.
